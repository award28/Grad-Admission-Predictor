Thank you for using the pre-application system in the Computer Science Department at

Your application was reviewed by our Faculty Admissions Committee, and then by

the entire faculty of the CS Department.   We were very impressed by your credentials

and believe you have a great deal of potential.  However, the faculty of the department

did not think your background was the best match for research currently underway in our

department as compared to other applicants.  Consequently, we must deny your

application to our PhD program.



If you did not already have an MS degree, an applicant in your situation would be

offered admission to our MS program.  However, since you do hold an MS degree,

we think it would be best if you were to pursue your goals somewhere where your

considerable skills could be better utilized.
